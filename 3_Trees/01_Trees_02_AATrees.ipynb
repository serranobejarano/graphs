    "AA trees are a variation of the red-black tree, a form of binary search tree which supports efficient addition and deletion of entries. Unlike red-black trees, red nodes on an AA tree can only be added as a right subchild. In other words, no red node can be a left sub-child. This results in the simulation of a 2-3 tree instead of a 2-3-4 tree, which greatly simplifies the maintenance operations.\n",

    "  - All values bigger than that of any node are stored in the subtree node.right and all the smaller ones in node.left\n",

    "\n",
    "  - We are searching in massive data, for instance all possible models that explain a phenomenon in a virtually unlimited space.\n",
    "  - We only have a \"quick and dirty\" score of how good the model could be (e.g., weighted correlation average of its factors).\n",
    "  - Fitting the model is computationally expensive, we want to fit the best models.\n",
    "  - When we fit good models, other candidate models that are variations of the fitted ones are interesting candidates to evaluate and join the priority queue.\n",
    "  \n",
    "So we have a priority queue from which any model gets in and only the best candidate gets out. In practice, searches like these take place in fields like human genetics, run for many days, evaluate millions of models and discard billions of lower scored models. The queue is even limited in size because a model waiting in the billionth position has no chance of making the top."
